# Sorting-Visualizer-
Embarking on a venture to enhance my understanding of my Algorithms Design and Analysis course at Cairo University, I took on a project to build a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer using Python and Pygame. With the fundamental sorting algorithms; namely, Heap Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quicksort, and Merge Sort implemented, I surely plan on adding more.

I also integrated a unique feature that triggers a "whoosh" sound, its loudness relative to the value of the element being swapped, each time two elements are swapped. This immersive experience brews a nice fusion of visualization and audibility.
